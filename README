About IMT3601-project
=====================

IMT3601-project or "Frank Darkhawks Amazing Maze RPG!" is a student/school
project. A lot of the code is messy. This is because it is a first in many areas
for the 4 main authors/contributors.

A word of warning though: there are inconsistencies and stupid designs/decisions
throughout the project.

Dependencies
============

The game is built using either visual studio or make and gcc.

The libraries used are:
SFML >= 2.0 <http://www.sfml-dev.org/>
BOOST >= 1.50.0 <http://www.boost.org/>

Installing and Running
======================

Linux
-----

Before running make do 'mkdir Debug' in the IMT3601-project directory.
The makefile is located within 'src/' and when run with 'make' or 'make all'
should produce '../main.bin'.

Windows
-------
TODO: write up this section.
I (thomas) has little to nothing to do with the windows build of the project,
I will try to push one of the other devs into writing up this section.

Mac
---
The 'src/Includes.hpp' file will need to be adjusted for Mac's positioning and
naming of libraries, But once that is fixed it should work fine with gcc and
make. See Linux setup above.
